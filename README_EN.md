## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: a presentation is due tomorrow, yet your slides remain blank; your mind is brimming with brilliant ideas, but your enthusiasm is drained by the tediousness of layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and aesthetically pleasing. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for speed, they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult to execute
- 3️⃣ Similar-looking final products with severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity
- 5️⃣ Fragmented image-text layouts with poor design aesthetics

These deficiencies make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy the twin demands of efficiency and aesthetics. Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPTs" are, in my opinion, far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I experimented with 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Furthermore, it can accurately render almost all text specified in the prompt while strictly adhering to the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Generate beautiful PPTs quickly with zero barrier to entry and no design experience, reducing the hassle of selecting templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Use AI-generated layouts and text-image combinations as a reference to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments and focus on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with rapid adaptation to multiple scenarios.

- [12-24]: The main branch now includes an editable pptx export method based on nano-banana-pro background extraction (currently in Beta).

## **🔧 FAQ**

1. **Garbled text or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can choose a higher output resolution (the OpenAI format may not support increasing resolution; Gemini format is recommended). Based on testing, adjusting resolution from 1k to 2k before page generation significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the specific text content to be rendered is included in the page description.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to API configuration issues. Please refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Is the Gemini API Key free tier supported?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **Encountering 503 error or Retry Error during content generation**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed 503 error; this is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why does the API Key set in .env not take effect?**
    - You need to restart the Docker container after editing the `.env` file at runtime to apply the changes.
    - If parameters were previously configured on the web settings page, they will override the parameters in the `.env` file. You can restore the `.env` settings by using the "Restore Default Settings" option.
